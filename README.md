# Movies!

The website aims to facilitate the communication of a hypothetical movie rental shop and its customers. It shows all the available movies and facilitates the process of ordering movies and getting them delivered to the customer.

This was the first project I created when I learned web programming and I did not know about databases yet. Hence, I implemented my database with CSV files.

# How to reproduce
Just copy the project to a directory inside WampServer and it will work.
